    <strong>In preparation for your appointment, here are a few things to keep in mind:</strong>

</p>
<ul style="font-family:Figtree, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:16px;line-height:145%;text-align:center;color:#000000;">
    <li>Eat a light meal before your appointment as it may be difficult to eat after the procedure.</li>
    <li>Wear comfortable clothing and avoid wearing any jewelry or accessories that may interfere with the dental
        equipment.</li>
    <li>Discuss any anxiety or concerns you may have with your dentist beforehand so that they can take steps to make
        you feel more comfortable during the procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-family:Figtree, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:16px;line-height:145%;text-align:center;color:#000000;">If
    you need to reschedule your appointment or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our office.</p>
